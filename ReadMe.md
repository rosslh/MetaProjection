MetaProjection is a web application that aggregates Canadian electoral projections from multiple sources and provides an overview of how the election is playing out, both federally and by district.

A map is displayed at the top of the page which indicates how each electoral district is likely to vote. The application uses the userâ€™s geolocation to find their district and display its likely winner.
